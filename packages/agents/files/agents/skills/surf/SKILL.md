# Surf

Follow the workflow below; open linked `docs/` only when the stated task or problem applies.

Run Python through `scripts/run.py`. Named browser threads persist between calls; Python variables and emission baselines live with the interpreter that ran the code.

- **Fresh interpreter** — `run.py FILE|-` starts a new interpreter for that call. Import and initialize handles each time; write intermediate data to files when a later call needs it.
- **Session** — `run.py --new-session -` creates an interpreter and reports its id; later cells pass `--session ID` and reuse variables, helpers and data. Sessions end when idle for their timeout (default 1800 s), or with `--kill-session ID`; `--list-sessions` shows what is live.

Choose one mode per task. Multi-step work that repeatedly inspects the same page benefits from a session; a one-shot script does not need one. Cells run sequentially: a second cell while one is running fails immediately instead of queueing.

The reported id is the session's only handle: an id that does not exist is refused rather than started, so keep it with the task and reuse only ids this task created. Another task's interpreter holds its own bindings and emission baseline, so attaching to it yields diffs against observations this task never received. If the id is lost, `--list-sessions` lists the live sessions with their working directory, and a task that waits on a human should create its session with a longer `--ttl`.

## Prepare

Set `SURF_SKILL` to the absolute directory containing this installed `SKILL.md`, not the working directory. Requires Python 3, `uv`, and Google Chrome; the launcher manages Python dependencies.

The launcher installs the runtime pinned by this skill. If it reports a missing or invalid pin, the skill is incorrectly installed; report that instead of working around it. For dependency failures, read [launcher setup](docs/launcher.md).

Run setup once, or after installation changes:

```bash
python3 "$SURF_SKILL/scripts/run.py" - <<'PY'
from surf_agent import Browser

browser = Browser()
browser.setup()
print(browser.backend())
print(browser.profile())
PY
```

For backend selection, profile configuration, or startup problems, read [backends](docs/backends.md) and its backend-specific guide.

## Browse, observe, decide

Use a unique thread name per task. Surf owns a dedicated Chrome window/profile, separate from the user's main browser. Reuse the name to continue the task without navigating again.

```bash
python3 "$SURF_SKILL/scripts/run.py" - <<'PY'
from surf_agent import Thread

thread = Thread("research-42")
thread.open("https://example.com")  # creates its window when missing
thread.emit(thread.snapshot())
PY
```

Inspect the snapshot before choosing targets. Batch deterministic actions until a new observation or human decision is needed:

```python
from surf_agent import Thread

thread = Thread("research-42")
thread.fill("@query", "browser skills")  # use a target from the observed snapshot
thread.press("Enter")
thread.emit(thread.snapshot())
```

A session keeps the initialized handle, its emission baseline and any helper or data from earlier cells. Create it once and keep the reported id; `--new-session` prints that id as the last stdout output of the call:

```bash
python3 "$SURF_SKILL/scripts/run.py" --new-session --name research - <<'PY'
from surf_agent import Thread

thread = Thread("research")
thread.open("https://example.com")
thread.emit(thread.snapshot())
PY
# … --- BEGIN session metadata --- / session_id: research-1f3a9c02 / --- END session metadata ---
```

```bash
python3 "$SURF_SKILL/scripts/run.py" --session research-1f3a9c02 - <<'PY'
thread.fill("@query", "browser skills")  # `thread` and its baseline survived
thread.press("Enter")
thread.emit(thread.snapshot())
PY
```

A session cell always comes from stdin; run a file without session options for an ordinary script. `--ttl SECONDS` at creation sets how long the session may stay idle, and `--kill-session ID` stops it early, including an interpreter that stopped answering.

Actions and observations are silent; print only useful results. `snapshot().text` is complete. `emit(snapshot)` outputs a numbered observation with explicit BEGIN/END boundaries: full text first, then useful diffs; `full=True` forces full output. Multiple emissions appear in order in the same script output, not separate agent turns. End the script when the next action requires a decision. Read [snapshot semantics](docs/python-api.md#snapshot-output) for the format, baselines or custom sinks.

Cell output is capped at 4 MB per stream, with a marker saying what was dropped and which stream was capped; the number of lines is not limited. A cell that needs more writes a file and reads back what it needs.

Pass a Python file or `-` for stdin; subsequent arguments reach `sys.argv`. For large text or JavaScript, read files in Python rather than nesting shell quoting:

```bash
python3 "$SURF_SKILL/scripts/run.py" /tmp/surf-step.py /tmp/body.txt /tmp/inspect.js
```

For action signatures and administrative operations, read [Python API](docs/python-api.md).

## Login and human unblock

For existing Chrome login state, read [cookie import](docs/cookie-import.md) before configuring access. For extension-based login, read [1Password setup](docs/1password-setup.md) once and [autofill](docs/1password-autofill.md) when logging in.

When blocked, ask the user to complete the blocker in the Surf Agent window and confirm when done. Preserve the page and wait for that confirmation, then inspect it using the same thread. Reopening the URL may destroy completed human work.

For manual login, close Surf automation windows and call `Browser().open_profile(url)`. Close manual Chrome before resuming automation. Bring a window forward with `Thread(name).focus()` only when requested.

## Recovery

After timeout or connection loss, inspect the same named thread before deciding whether to repeat an action: submissions, purchases, or messages may already have taken effect.

A cell that exceeds `--timeout SECONDS` (default 300) destroys the session interpreter: the call reports the replacement, the id stops existing, and the failed cell's side effects are unknown. The browser thread survives. Create a session again with `--new-session`, reattach with `Thread(name)`, emit a full observation, and inspect before repeating anything; a new handle has no baseline, so its first emission is full. `--session ID --reset` discards bindings without replacing the interpreter or the id.

An interpreter that did not answer is busy, suspended or wedged rather than absent: it still holds the session's bindings, so it is never replaced silently, and a cell that holds the interpreter lock reads the same way as a wedged one. Let any cell you started finish first. `--list-sessions` keeps it and marks it unresponsive, and `--kill-session ID` stops it. If a call reports that the interpreter could not be identified, stop that pid yourself; a host that cannot prove which process owns the socket does not signal one. The browser thread survives either way.

`is_open()` checks without creating a page, but false can also mean the bridge is unavailable. Reopen only when absence is established and navigation is safe. For a persistently unavailable bridge, use `Browser().stop_bridge()`; the next browser action restarts it. Restarting does not make replay safe.

## Cleanup

Close every thread you opened when its work is complete, including after errors; retain a thread only for an explicit pending human handoff. A session interpreter ends when it has been idle for its timeout or is stopped; closing threads remains the caller's job.

```python
from surf_agent import Browser, Thread

Thread("research-42").close()
Browser().close_matching("run-42-*")
```

Use only task-owned cleanup patterns. `close_matching("*")` requires ownership of all remembered threads. For inventory or intentional detachment, consult the [API reference](docs/python-api.md).
