# Launcher setup and validation

Read this for dependency or release-installation failures, or deliberate local development validation. Normal invocation and browser workflow belong in [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md#prepare).

## Dependencies and execution

`scripts/run.py` requires Python 3 and `uv` on PATH. It asks uv for Python 3.11 and `surf-agent[patchright]`, independently of the current project's environment and uv configuration. Install missing uv using its [installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

The launcher executes Python directly: file-relative imports, working directory, script arguments, stdin, exceptions and exit codes follow ordinary Python behavior. It does not process inline dependency metadata. Google Chrome is a separate prerequisite; see [Patchright setup](patchright-backend.md#setup-and-selection) for detection and executable overrides.

## Published runtime

`runtime-revision`, beside `SKILL.md`, selects a full 40-character Git commit for the runtime dependency. Users update the skill; the launcher installs its matching runtime.

A missing or invalid pin is an installation defect. Stop and report it, then update or repair the installed skill. If the pinned commit cannot be fetched, report that failure.

## Sessions

`run.py --new-session [--name SLUG] [--ttl SECONDS] -` creates an interpreter and reports the session id as the last stdout output of that call; [SKILL.md](../SKILL.md) covers when a session is worth using:

```text
--- BEGIN session metadata ---
session_id: research-1f3a9c02
idle_timeout_s: 1800
--- END session metadata ---
```

`run.py --session ID -` runs the next cell in that interpreter, `--session ID --reset` discards its bindings without replacing it, and `--timeout SECONDS` bounds a cell (default 300). Ids are opaque: a call naming a session that does not exist is refused with the live list rather than starting a new interpreter.

A session ends when it has been idle for `--ttl` seconds (default 1800), measured between cells, so a running cell is never cut by it, or when `run.py --kill-session ID` stops it. `run.py --list-sessions` prints each live session with its interpreter pid, cell count, idle time, timeout and working directory.

Each session is one socket file in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/surf-agent/` (the state directory when `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` is unset); that file is the whole session record. The interpreter keeps the environment, working directory and Python bindings of the call that created it, runs cells sequentially, and points its own stdout and stderr at `/dev/null`: cell output travels over the socket, so only `print()` and `emit()` reach the caller. Raw file-descriptor writes, subprocess output, and anything written after the interpreter dies are dropped.

If a call reports that the interpreter did not answer, it is suspended or wedged. Stop it with `--kill-session ID`, or resume it (`kill -CONT <pid>`) to keep its bindings; browser threads survive either way.

## Local development validation

Only when deliberately testing local runtime changes, supply an existing built wheel by absolute path:

```bash
export SURF_AGENT_DEPENDENCY=/absolute/path/surf_agent-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
python3 "$SURF_SKILL/scripts/run.py" - <<'PY'
from surf_agent import Browser
Browser().setup()
PY
```

This override bypasses the revision pin and installs the wheel with its Patchright extra. It accepts a wheel, not a source checkout or arbitrary dependency string. Successful local validation does not verify remote installation. Unset `SURF_AGENT_DEPENDENCY` when testing a published pin.
